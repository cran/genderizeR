\title{Calculating classification errors and other prediction indicators}
\usage{
classificationErrors(labels, predictions)
}
\arguments{
\item{labels}{A vector of true labels. Should have following 
values: c("female", "male", "unknown", "noname"). \code{noname} stands also for 
initials only.}

\item{predictions}{A vector of predicted gender. Should have following 
values: c("female", "male", NA). \code{NA} when it was not possible 
to predict a gender.}
}
\value{
A list of gender prediction efficiency indicators:
\describe{
  \item{confMatrix}{Full confusion matrix.}
  \item{errorTotal}{Total classification error calculated on the matrix.}
  \item{errorFullFirstNames}{Classification error calculated without "noname" category.}
  \item{errorCoded}{Classification error calculated without both "noname" and "unknown" category.}
  \item{errorCodedWithoutNA}{Classification error calculated only on "female" and "male" categories from both predictions and labels.}
  \item{naTotal}{Total proportion of items with unpredicted gender.}
  \item{naFullFirstNames}{Proportion of items with unpredicted gender calculated without "noname" category.}
  \item{naCoded}{Proportion of items with unpredicted gender calculated without both "noname" and "unknown" category.}
  \item{errorGenderBias}{Calculated as follows: "male" classified as "female" minus "female" classified as "male" and divided by the sum of items in "female" and "male" categories from both predictions and labels.}
  
  
}
}
\description{
\code{classificationErrors} builds confusion matrix from manually coded
 and predicted gender vectors and returns 
 classification errors calculated on that matrix.
