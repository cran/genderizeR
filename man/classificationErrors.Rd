\title{Calculating classification errors and other prediction indicators}
\usage{
classificationErrors(labels, predictions)
}
\arguments{
\item{labels}{A vector of true labels. Should have following 
values: c("female", "male", "unknown", "noname"). \code{noname} stands also for 
initials only.}

\item{predictions}{A vector of predicted gender. Should have following 
values: c("female", "male", NA). \code{NA} when it was not possible to predict any gender.}
}
\value{
A list of gender prediction efficency indicators:
\describe{
  \item{confMatrix}{full confusion matrix}
  \item{errorTotal}{total classification error}
  \item{errorFullFirstNames}{classification error without "noname" category}
  \item{errorCoded}{classification error without both "noname" and "unknown" category}
  \item{errorCodedWithoutNA}{classification error only on "female" and "male" categories in both predictions and labels}
  \item{naTotal}{total proportion of items with unpredicted gender}
  \item{naFullFirstNames}{proportion of items with unpredicted gender without "noname" category}
  \item{naCoded}{proportion of items with unpredicted gender without both "noname" and "unknown" category}
  \item{errorGenderBias}{"male" classified as "female" minus "female" classifed as "male" and divided by the sum of items in "female" and "male" categories in both predictions and labels}
  
  
}
}
\description{
\code{classificationErrors} builds confusion matrix from manually coded
 and predicted gender vectors and returns different 
 specific classification errors calculated on that matrix.
