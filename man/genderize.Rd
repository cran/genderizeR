\title{Predicting gender for character strings.}
\usage{
genderize(x, genderDB, blacklist = NULL, progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of text strings.}

\item{genderDB}{A data table output of  \code{findGivenNames} function 
for the vector x.}

\item{blacklist}{A character vector of terms (stopwords) that will be 
excluded from gender checking.}

\item{progress}{If TRUE (default) progress bar is displayed in the console.}
}
\value{
A data table with text string, a term found in \code{genderDB},
 that is finally used as a given name to predict gender of the string, 
 a predicted gender, a number of potential gender indicators 
(eg. 1 if only one term from the text string is found in \code{genderDB}).
}
